Hey there,

I’m a Geomatics professional with a passion for using geospatial technology to address environmental challenges. Currently pursuing a Master’s in Geomatics for Environmental Management (MGEM) at UBC, I’ve been building skills in GIS, remote sensing, and geospatial data analysis.

I enjoy working on projects that apply geospatial tools in innovative ways, like mapping mangroves with Sentinel-2 imagery or creating predictive models to support conservation efforts. My work focuses on leveraging geospatial technology to make a tangible difference in environmental sustainability and resource management.
