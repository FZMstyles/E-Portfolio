Hey there,

I am currently pursuing a Master of Geomatics for Environmental Management (MGEM), leveraging remote sensing and geospatial technologies to support environmental conservation. My passion for this field is deeply rooted in the belief that we must give back to our communities and the natural world.

A guiding principle in my journey comes from my late grandfatherâ€™s words:
"Those who receive privilege have the duty to return for the sacrifice of others."

The environment belongs to all species, and safeguarding our rich natural heritage is a priority. Geospatial technology is a powerful tool to address this crucial agenda, enabling us to better understand, monitor, and protect ecosystems for future generations. Through this e-portfolio, I aim to showcase my work and contributions toward this mission.
